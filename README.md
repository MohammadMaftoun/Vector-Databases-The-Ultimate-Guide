# 🔍 What Are Vector Databases?

Vector databases have emerged to handle high-dimensional data that exceeds the capabilities of traditional database management systems. They are now tightly integrated with large language models as well as widely applied in modern artificial intelligence systems. The backbone of modern AI applications includes:

* 🔗 **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**
* 🤖 **LLM-powered assistants**
* 📚 **Semantic search engines**
* 🛒 **Recommendation systems**
* 🧠 **Cognitive search & knowledge graphs**

This repository serves as your gateway to understanding how to utilize vector search at scale.
